Note: that the navigation bar doesnt push things out of the way but rather 
if the website is full it just fucking disappears lol
 needs to be made first or move all your items in 
your website away from where the navigation should appear otherwise other stuff
will interfere with it

2nd note: IF you want a fixed and big working you need to literally put the code for
the navigation bar to be the first thing over everything

Gameplay:
<br>
<br>
1. How to click the right choice:
<br>
<br>
<br>
1a. If you see  the racket/red move down then press "back" button 
<br><br>
1b. If you see the racket move up/re√∏d move up when contacting the ball then press "top" button
<br><br>
1c. If you see the racket not a lot up or down while contacting the ball then press "dead" button
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
2. If you make the correct choice just press anywhere on the bottom half of the screen to continue or click load 
video to see why your choice was wrong. 
<br>
<br>
3. If you make the wrong choice then there will be two buttons on the top half and nothing on the bottom 
such that it is hard to skip watching the video which automatically plays to show you why you chose 
the wrong 
answer.
<br>
<br>
4. To the right of the video player will be a try again button to restart you to level 1 again.
<br>
<br>
5. There is a timer to the top right which turns more red as its invisible hand turns clockwise. When one 1/4 
pie shape of red appears then that means 1/4 of the total time has elapsed. Inside is a long 
<br>
<br>
6. If you have played one game and failed you see a crown icon above the score board in every new reattempt in 
order to show what to beat next. 
<br>
<br>
7. The score:[insert number] will be your current score during your attempt. 
<br>
<br>
8. The black heart with the white number will count down by one each time you lose a life.
<br>
<br>
9. You will be able to access the leaderboards while in the continue pop up, retry pop or in the main menu. 
In the continue pop up and retry pop up it will be all the day on the top middle of the screen and the 
leaderboard icon will be on the bottom of the start button in the main menu section.
